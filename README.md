# My First Website
This website is the first portfolio that I can be proud of. This is the assignment that I have to work on to get a certificate from Dicoding. When I saw the best website last year that got promoted from Dicoding itself, I felt small. I felt that I can't do better than that, but I promised myself that I will do my best. 

At first, I felt like this would be a burden to me, but in the process of making it, I enjoyed it. I worked day and night and never get bored while making it. I'm struggling but at the same time, I'm eager to learn more and improve my website. 

I hope in the future I can make more websites and still enjoy every bit process of it.
